demo-bash(1)
============

NAME
----
demo-bash - media analytics containers entrypoint

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'demo-bash' [<command> [<arguments>]]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'demo-bash' is media analytics containers entrypoint. It gets executed anytime
you try to run anything via container. This script assures that correct
environment is setup and acts as follows. First it `source /etc/demo.env` to
get demo environment variables. Then it executes `demo-setup` script which
should setup demo environment and return non-zero exit status in case of
any errors. If 'demo-bash' sees an error form `demo-setup` it exits
immediately dumping error message to `stderr`. This behavior can be
overwritten with `IGNORE_ERRORS=yes` enviroment variable.

In the very end 'demo-bash' executes specified command.

Media analytics containers are configured in a way that if no command is
specified they just enter shell displaying welcome message. The latter
is achieved via helper 'hello-bash' script which gets passed to
'demo-bash' as a command by default.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------

IGNORE_ERRORS=yes|no::
	Ignore any errors during demo setup and enter the container. This
can be useful if you want to check container structure or component versions
without really running the demo on a system without GPU. (default: `no`)
